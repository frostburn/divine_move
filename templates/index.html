        <p>There probably should be a donate button somewhere around here. The servers don't run themselves, you know. In the mean time have $10 worth of credit on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=714c4c1dc08a">DigitalOcean</a> cloud hosting. (If you follow the link with the ref code intact I get $25 once you've spent $25. This helps cover the hosting costs.)</p>
